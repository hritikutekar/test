(I just add to a bowl using water from my refrigerator and top with ice.)\n\nWhen you’re ready to fry the potatoes, preheat oil in a deep-fryer, Dutch oven or large pot to 375°F and line two baking sheets with paper towels; set aside.\n\nRinse the chilled fries thoroughly under cold running water and drain thoroughly. Transfer the potatoes to a tea towel. Using another tea towel, cover and pat dry all of the fries.\n\nTransfer the fries to a gallon-size zipper storage bag and add the egg yolks. Seal shut and smear the egg yolk all over the fries to evenly distribute.\n\nWorking in batches of three, fry the potatoes for 3 minutes. Drain using a spider or the basket of your deep-fryer. Transfer the hot fries to the lined baking sheet and cool for 30 minutes. Continue to par-fry the other two batches in the same manner.\n\nOnce all of the fries are fried one time and the first batch has cooled, fry them again at 375°F for an additional 5 minutes or until crispy and brown to your liking.\n\nWhile their frying a second time, line the baking sheets with clean paper towels.\n\nTransfer the fried French fries to the baking sheets and allow to drain. Lightly press the oil out of the tops with additional paper towels. Serve and enjoy!",
